#### ABOUT

> ASTRA Skincare is a site made for demonstration purposes only. It's a custom front-end app for a Shopify webstore. The products, cart, and checkout object are all hosted on Shopify and interacted with through the Shopify Buy SDK and the Shopify Storefront API. This site acts as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the possibilities of having a custom, highly-responsive front-end for a Shopify webstore with all of the features of managing products, customers, orders, etc. via the store's Shopify Admin.

#### MOTIVATION

> This project was the first project that I collaborated with my partner on. Over two years ago I jokingly said to her that I should become a web developer so that we can make websites together. She is an incredible designer and the key reason why I am so proud of this project. I love programming and creating functionality but when the end result is so beautiful to look at, I think it makes it 10 times better.

### MORE

> Check my [developer blog](https://cjfritz.dev/blogs) about this project for more about what I learned and the tools that I used to streamline design to development, from Figma to VSCode using powerful tools like Chakra UI's Figpilot & more.
